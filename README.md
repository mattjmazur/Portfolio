<h2>hash_map_implementation</h2>
<ul>
<li>includes two implementations of a hashmap abstact data type: one using separate-chaining collision resolution and the other using open-addressing</li>
<li>methods of each hashmap were written with time complexity constraints outlined in the assignment prompt (PDF of prompt included in the folder)</li>
<li>highlighted skills/technologies: python, efficient implementation of abstract data types, object-oriented programming</li>
</ul>
<h2>ludo_game</h2>
