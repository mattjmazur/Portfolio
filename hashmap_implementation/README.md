<h1>hashmap_implementation</h1>
<ul>
<li>includes two implementations of a hashmap abstact data type: one using separate-chaining collision resolution (hashmap_sc.py) and the other using open-addressing collison resolution (hashmap_oa./py)</li>
<li>methods of each hashmap were written with time complexity constraints outlined in the assignment prompt (PDF of prompt included in the folder)</li>
<li>highlighted skills/technologies: python, efficient implementation of abstract data types, object-oriented programming</li>
</ul>
